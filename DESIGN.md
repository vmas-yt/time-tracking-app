description: "A confident black-and-white editorial frame interrupted by oversized, hand-cut pastel color blocks. The marketing canvas is rigorously monochrome — figmaSans variable type, pure white surfaces, pure black ink, pill-shaped CTAs — while each story section drops the page into a saturated lime, lavender, cream, mint, or pink panel that reads like a sticky note placed on a clean desk. The result is a design system that feels both technical and joyful — a tool for serious work, made by people who like color."

## Overview

Figma's marketing canvas is, at the system level, an editor-clean black-and-white frame. The chrome — top nav, body type, footer, primary CTA — is monochrome. Headlines are oversized `{typography.display-xl}` set in `figmaSans` with aggressive negative tracking, body copy hovers around weight 320–340 of the same variable family, and small mono `{typography.eyebrow}` and `{typography.caption}` labels (figmaMono, all-caps, positive tracking) act as section markers. Every CTA is a pill — `{rounded.pill}` — and the primary action across the entire site is the same black `{components.button-primary}` paired with the same white `{components.button-secondary}`.

What makes the design unique is what happens **between** those monochrome bookends: the page repeatedly drops into oversized pastel **color-block sections** — lime, lavender, cream, mint, pink, coral, and a deep navy — that span the full content width with `{rounded.lg}` corners and `{spacing.xxl}` interior padding. These blocks are where the storytelling lives. They aren't accents tucked into a card; they take over a whole viewport's worth of vertical space, like a designer arranging giant sticky notes on a clean wall. FigJam is the most pastel-saturated, the home page rotates through the full set, and the pricing page ends with a lime FAQ panel — same vocabulary, different rhythm per route.

This is a system built on contrast: the monochrome chrome makes the color blocks feel intentional rather than decorative, and the color blocks make the monochrome chrome feel like editorial paper rather than enterprise SaaS. Density is generous, line-heights are tight on display sizes, and the interface never reaches for shadows or gradients to do the work that color blocks and confident typography already do.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Monochrome system core: `{colors.primary}` (black) and `{colors.canvas}` (white) carry every CTA, every body line, every footer link.
- Oversized pastel **color-block sections** (`{colors.block-lime}`, `{colors.block-lilac}`, `{colors.block-cream}`, `{colors.block-mint}`, `{colors.block-pink}`, `{colors.block-coral}`, `{colors.block-navy}`) define the narrative rhythm of every long-form page.
- Pill is the only button shape — `{rounded.pill}` for text CTAs, `{rounded.full}` for icon buttons. No square buttons anywhere.
- `figmaSans` variable typeface used at unusually fine weight increments (320, 330, 340, 450, 480, 540) — the type system reads as a single voice that flexes rather than a multi-weight family.
- Tight negative letter-spacing on display sizes (-1.72px at 86px, -0.96px at 64px) creates a confident editorial cadence.
- `figmaMono` reserved for category labels, eyebrows, and captions — always uppercase, positive tracking — to flag taxonomy without competing with display type.
- Color-block page rhythm (home): white hero → marquee strip → white feature → lime systems block → navy ship-products block → coral developer block → white template grid → white footer.

## Colors

> Source pages: figma.com (home), /design/, /figjam/brainstorming-tool/, /pricing/, /contact/.

### Brand & Accent
- **Black** ({colors.primary}): The system primary. Every primary CTA, every headline, every body line, the marquee strip, the inverse canvas of dark sections.
- **White** ({colors.on-primary}): Inverse text on black surfaces; also the canvas color used as the foreground of secondary pill buttons (`{components.button-secondary}`).
- **Magenta Promo** ({colors.accent-magenta}): A single saturated CTA pink reserved for promotional inline buttons — appears, for example, on the lilac "Save your spot" Release Notes banner. Use scarcely; it is not a section color.

### Surface
- **Canvas** ({colors.canvas}): Default page background and the body of every white card.
- **Inverse Canvas** ({colors.inverse-canvas}): Footer, marquee strip, and a subset of "ship products"-style story sections.
- **Surface Soft** ({colors.surface-soft}): Off-white tile background used for icon buttons, template cards, and feature illustration tiles when they sit on the white canvas.
- **Hairline** ({colors.hairline}): 1px borders on form inputs, pricing cards, and table dividers.
- **Hairline Soft** ({colors.hairline-soft}): Even subtler dividers — comparison-table row separators and footer column rules.
- **Block Lime** ({colors.block-lime}): The signature **systems / FAQ / contact-form** color block. Recurs across home, pricing, contact.
- **Block Lilac** ({colors.block-lilac}): Hero block on `/design/`; also the inline Release Notes promo banner.
- **Block Cream** ({colors.block-cream}): Soft warm background — FigJam hero strip, template-grid section.
- **Block Mint** ({colors.block-mint}): FigJam pastel section.
- **Block Pink** ({colors.block-pink}): FigJam pastel section.
- **Block Coral** ({colors.block-coral}): "Ship products" coral story block on home.
- **Block Navy** ({colors.block-navy}): Deep indigo story block — only place dark surfaces appear above the footer.

### Text
- **Ink** ({colors.ink}): All headline, body, and caption type on light surfaces. There is no softer mid-gray text role on marketing — body copy is always black at weight 320–340, and weight (not opacity) carries the hierarchy.
- **Inverse Ink** ({colors.inverse-ink}): Type on inverse-canvas surfaces (footer, marquee strip, navy color block).
- **On-Inverse Soft** ({colors.on-inverse-soft}): White used at ~16% opacity for circular icon-button surfaces against dark sections (token captures the base color; the translucency is applied at render time).

### Semantic
- **Success Green** ({colors.semantic-success}): Comparison-table checkmarks on pricing. Used as a glyph fill, not a surface.
- **Overlay Scrim** ({colors.overlay-scrim}): Black used at ~60% opacity behind modal / video-overlay surfaces (token captures the base; opacity applied at render time).

## Typography

### Font Family

- **figmaSans** — Figma's proprietary variable typeface; fallback stack `figmaSans Fallback, SF Pro Display, system-ui, helvetica`. Variable weight axis is exercised at unusually fine increments (320, 330, 340, 450, 480, 540, 700) — the design system reads as a single voice modulating rather than a stepped weight family.
- **figmaMono** — Proprietary monospace; fallback `figmaMono Fallback, SF Mono, menlo`. Used exclusively for eyebrow labels and captions, always uppercase with positive letter-spacing.

OpenType `kern` is enabled across every role.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 86px | 340 | 1.00 | -1.72px | Hero headlines (home, FigJam) |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 64px | 340 | 1.10 | -0.96px | Section opener headlines |
| `{typography.headline}` | 26px | 540 | 1.35 | -0.26px | Story-block titles inside color blocks |
| `{typography.subhead}` | 26px | 340 | 1.35 | -0.26px | Long-form intro paragraphs that sit at near-headline scale |
| `{typography.card-title}` | 24px | 700 | 1.45 | 0 | Pricing-tier titles, feature card titles |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 20px | 330 | 1.40 | -0.14px | Lead body copy on hero, contact form labels |
| `{typography.body}` | 18px | 320 | 1.45 | -0.26px | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 16px | 330 | 1.45 | -0.14px | Card body, footer link list |
| `{typography.link}` | 20px | 480 | 1.40 | -0.10px | Inline link emphasis |
| `{typography.button}` | 20px | 480 | 1.40 | -0.10px | All pill buttons, primary and secondary |
| `{typography.eyebrow}` | 18px | 400 | 1.30 | 0.54px | figmaMono uppercase section eyebrows |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.00 | 0.60px | figmaMono uppercase captions, footer column heads |

### Principles

- **Weight, not size, carries hierarchy on body copy.** A 20px paragraph at weight 330 sits next to a 20px link at weight 480 — the eye reads emphasis without scale change.
- **Negative letter-spacing scales with size.** Display-xl pulls -1.72px; subhead pulls only -0.26px. Body copy stays near-zero. The result is editorial-feeling display type without sacrificing readability at body size.
- **Mono is taxonomy, not body.** figmaMono is reserved for eyebrows and captions — never used to set a paragraph.
- **Tight line-heights on display, generous on body.** Display sizes run 1.00–1.10; body runs 1.40–1.45. The contrast reinforces that headlines are graphics and body copy is for reading.

### Note on Font Substitutes

If implementing without access to figmaSans / figmaMono, suitable open-source substitutes are **Inter** (or **Geist**) for the sans, and **JetBrains Mono** (or **Geist Mono**) for the mono. Inter at variable weights closely matches the fine-grained weight axis figmaSans uses; expect to manually adjust line-heights down by ~0.02 to compensate for Inter's slightly taller x-height.

## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit**: 8px.
- **Tokens (front matter)**: `{spacing.hair}` 1px · `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 32px · `{spacing.xxl}` 48px · `{spacing.section}` 96px.
- Section interior padding: `{spacing.xxl}` (48px) on color-block sections.
- Card interior padding: `{spacing.lg}` (24px) on pricing cards and template tiles.
- Form input padding: `{spacing.sm}` 12px vertical · 14px horizontal.
- Button padding: `{spacing.xs}` 8px vertical · `{spacing.lg}` 24px horizontal for pill buttons (the asymmetric `8px 18px 10px` extracted on `button-secondary` nudges the type optically inside the pill).
- Universal rhythm constant: `{spacing.section}` (96px) — the vertical gap between major content sections holds across home, pricing, and FigJam pages.

### Grid & Container

- Max content width sits around 1280px (one of the explicit breakpoints), with side gutters that scale from `{spacing.xxl}` on desktop down to `{spacing.lg}` on mobile.
- Three- and four-column grids on the desktop pricing comparison and FigJam template galleries.
- Color-block sections break the column grid — they span content width with full bleed inside the rounded `{rounded.lg}` corners, then place a single editorial column of headline + body inside.

### Whitespace Philosophy

White space is used to make the color blocks feel deliberate. Between every colored panel and the next, the page returns to white canvas with `{spacing.section}` of breathing room. Inside a color block, the type itself is given generous side margins (often more than 1/4 of the block's width on each side) so the panel reads as a poster, not a wall of copy.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (flat) | No shadow, no border | Default for color-block sections, inverse-canvas footer, hero |
| 1 (hairline) | 1px `{colors.hairline}` border on `{colors.canvas}` | Pricing cards, form inputs, comparison table cells |
| 2 (soft elevation) | Subtle drop shadow approx 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06) | Floating template tiles, dropdown menus |
| 3 (modal) | Stronger shadow + `{colors.overlay-scrim}` behind | Video / image lightbox overlays |

Figma's marketing system is shadow-light by design — the color blocks substitute for traditional elevation. Where most SaaS sites use a shadowed white card to draw attention, Figma uses a saturated background panel. This makes the rare actual shadow (e.g., a floating template card hovering over a cream section) feel like an exception worth noticing.

### Decorative Depth

- **Color-block sections** are the primary depth device. The change from white canvas to lime / lavender / cream is the section break.
- **Sticky-note style component thumbnails** in FigJam — slightly off-axis pastel rectangles arranged like notes on a board — read as collage, not card-stack.
- **Embedded product UI mocks** (Figma Design panels, FigJam canvas snippets) appear as flat compositions on color blocks; their internal shadows are subtle and stay within the mock.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Anchor / link decoration corners |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Small chips, sub-nav tabs |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Form inputs, list items, image frames |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 24px | Pricing cards, color-block sections, large image containers |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 32px | Hero feature panels, oversized callouts |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 50px | All text CTAs (primary, secondary, tab toggles) |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Circular icon buttons, comparison-table checkmark glyphs |

### Photography & Illustration Geometry

- Image frames use `{rounded.md}` (8px) — generous enough to feel friendly, conservative enough to read as editorial.
- Template thumbnails on the home grid sit in `{rounded.md}` tiles with `{spacing.md}` interior padding around the embedded preview.
- FigJam pastel sticky-note component thumbnails preserve a small `{rounded.sm}` corner that mimics actual sticky paper.
- No avatar circles appear in marketing surfaces — Figma's marketing avoids personification.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — The black "Get started for free" pill that appears in the top nav, every hero, and every closing CTA.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button}`, padding 10px 20px, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.
- Pressed state lives in `button-primary-pressed` (same surface; the live site relies on micro-scale rather than a darkened fill).

**`button-secondary`** — White pill with black text. Used for tertiary navigation actions ("Contact sales") and as the visual counterpart to the primary pill.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.button}`, padding 8px 18px 10px (asymmetric vertical to optically center the type), rounded `{rounded.pill}`. No border.

**`button-tertiary-text`** — Plain text link styled as a button hit target inside top nav and footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.link}`, rounded `{rounded.full}` (hit target only), padding `{spacing.xs}` `{spacing.sm}`.

**`button-icon-circular`** — 40px circular icon button used for carousel controls, social links, and inline actions on light surfaces.
- Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`, size 40px.

**`button-icon-circular-inverse`** — Same shape, used on inverse-canvas / dark color blocks.
- Background `{colors.on-inverse-soft}` (translucent white), text `{colors.inverse-ink}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`, size 40px.

**`button-magenta-promo`** — Saturated pink pill used only inside promotional surfaces such as the lilac "Save your spot" Release Notes banner. Reserved for moments where Figma's product team wants the CTA to pop against an already-colored panel.
- Background `{colors.accent-magenta}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button}`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`, padding 10px 18px.

### Pricing Tabs

**`pricing-tab-default`** + **`pricing-tab-selected`** — The pill-toggle that switches between Starter / Professional / Organization / Enterprise on `/pricing/`.
- Default: `{colors.canvas}` background, `{colors.ink}` text, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.
- Selected: `{colors.primary}` background, `{colors.on-primary}` text — exactly the same surface as `button-primary`, which makes the selected tab feel like an active CTA, not a passive state.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** + **`text-input-focused`** — Form fields on `/contact/` and pricing seat-count steppers.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding 12px 14px.
- Focused state retains the same surface — focus is communicated via ring, not via fill change.

### Cards & Containers

**`pricing-card`** — Each tier on `/pricing/`.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.lg}`. Stroked with `{colors.hairline}` rather than shadowed.

**`pricing-card-feature-row`** — Single row inside the comparison table.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`. Row separator is `{colors.hairline-soft}`.

**`template-card`** — Thumbnail tile in the home "Explore what people are making" grid and the FigJam template gallery.
- Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding `{spacing.md}`.

**`feature-illustration-tile`** — Larger composition tile that holds a product UI mock or pastel illustration.
- Background `{colors.surface-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.eyebrow}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding `{spacing.lg}`.

### Color-Block Sections (signature)

The defining surface of Figma's marketing. Each is a full-content-width panel with `{rounded.lg}` corners and `{spacing.xxl}` interior padding. Variants:

**`color-block-section`** — lime ground for "systems" stories (home), pricing FAQ, and the contact form.
- Background `{colors.block-lime}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.subhead}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`.

**`color-block-section-lilac`** — lavender ground for `/design/` hero and FigJam highlight sections.
- Background `{colors.block-lilac}`, otherwise identical structure.

**`color-block-section-navy`** — deep indigo ground for the home "Ship products" story block. The only inverse color-block surface above the footer.
- Background `{colors.block-navy}`, text `{colors.inverse-ink}`, otherwise identical structure.

(Cream, mint, pink, and coral block variants follow the same shape with their respective `{colors.block-*}` surface.)

### Promo Banner

**`promo-banner-lilac`** — The Release Notes / "Save your spot" inline banner that floats above the contact form.
- Background `{colors.block-lilac}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, rounded `{rounded.md}`, padding `{spacing.md}` `{spacing.lg}`. Carries a `button-magenta-promo` on the right edge.

### Navigation

**`top-nav`** — Sticky white bar with logo, primary nav links, sign-in link, and the right-anchored `button-secondary` ("Contact sales") + `button-primary` ("Get started for free") pair.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, height 56px.
- Mobile: collapses primary links into a hamburger that opens a full-canvas overlay; the two pill CTAs remain visible on the bar.

**`marquee-strip`** — Thin black ribbon directly under the nav that scrolls through customer logos in white.
- Background `{colors.inverse-canvas}`, text `{colors.inverse-ink}`, type `{typography.body-sm}`, height 36px.

### Comparison Glyphs

**`comparison-checkmark`** — Green check used in the pricing comparison matrix.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, glyph color `{colors.semantic-success}`, rounded `{rounded.full}`, size 16px.

### Footer

**`footer`** — Dense link grid on white canvas with the wordmark "Figma" set in display weight at the top-left.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.caption}` for column headings and small links, padding `{spacing.section}` top/bottom · `{spacing.xl}` sides.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for genuine primary CTAs and selected states (e.g., `pricing-tab-selected`). Don't use it as a decorative accent.
- When introducing a story section, choose **one** color block from the `{colors.block-*}` family and let it span full content width with `{rounded.lg}` corners and `{spacing.xxl}` interior padding.
- Keep type in `figmaSans` at variable weights — pick from 320, 330, 340, 480, 540, 700 to express hierarchy. Avoid intermediate weights outside this set.
- Use `figmaMono` only for eyebrows and captions, always uppercase, with the documented positive letter-spacing.
- Compose every CTA as a pill (`{rounded.pill}`) and every icon button as a circle (`{rounded.full}`).
- Allow the page to **return to white canvas** between every two color blocks so each block reads as deliberate.
- Pair `button-primary` and `button-secondary` whenever a section needs both a primary action and a sales / secondary action — the black-and-white pair is the brand signature.

### Don't

- Don't introduce mid-gray text. Body hierarchy comes from `figmaSans` weight, not from opacity.
- Don't add drop shadows to color-block sections — the color is the depth device.
- Don't introduce new accent colors outside the documented `{colors.block-*}` palette and `{colors.accent-magenta}`. Adding, e.g., a saturated brand orange would break the system.
- Don't combine more than one color block visible inside a single viewport — Figma's pacing always lets the white canvas separate them.
- Don't square off CTAs. Square buttons read as a different brand.
- Don't put `figmaMono` in body copy — it's a taxonomy tool, not a reading typeface.
- Don't replace the `pricing-tab-selected` black fill with a colored tab; the brand pattern is "selected = primary surface".

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| 4k | 1920px | Max content width holds at 1280px; gutters expand |
| Desktop-XL | 1440px | Default desktop layout |
| Desktop | 1400px | Comparison table column widths normalize |
| Desktop-S | 1280px | Pricing 4-up tier grid maintained |
| Tablet | 960px | Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up; nav becomes hamburger |
| Mobile-L | 768px | Color-block sections become full-bleed (no rounded corners on edges) |
| Mobile | 560px | Display-xl reduces from 86px to ~48px; pill CTAs go full-width |
| Mobile-XS | 559px | Two-column footer collapses to single column |

### Touch Targets

- Pill buttons (`button-primary`, `button-secondary`) maintain a minimum 44px tap height across all viewports — achieved by combining `{typography.button}` 20px line-height with the documented vertical padding.
- Circular icon buttons (`button-icon-circular`) are 40px on desktop and grow to 44px on touch viewports.
- Form input minimum tap target on `/contact/` is 48px high.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Nav**: desktop horizontal nav with two right-anchored pills collapses to a hamburger overlay below 960px. The two pills (`Contact sales`, `Get started for free`) stay visible on the bar above 560px and stack in the overlay below.
- **Pricing tier grid**: 4-up → 2-up at 960px → 1-up below 768px. The pill toggle stays horizontal and scrolls horizontally if needed below 560px.
- **Color-block sections**: above 768px the section keeps `{spacing.xxl}` of canvas around it so the rounded corners read; below 768px the corners are removed and the block bleeds to viewport edge for a poster effect.
- **Comparison table**: below 960px the matrix collapses into per-tier accordions to avoid horizontal scroll.

### Image Behavior

- Product UI mocks inside color blocks scale proportionally and never crop. Below 768px they shrink rather than reflow.
- Template thumbnails in the home grid use lazy loading and animate in on scroll.
- Sticky-note style FigJam thumbnails maintain their slight off-axis rotation across breakpoints — the rotation is a brand signal, not a desktop-only flourish.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time and reference it by its `components:` token name (e.g., `{components.button-primary}`, `{components.color-block-section}`).
2. When introducing a new section, decide **first** which `{colors.block-*}` token it sits on; the surface choice is the most consequential decision.
3. Default body type to `{typography.body}`; reach for `{typography.subhead}` or `{typography.headline}` only inside a color block.
4. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits — `broken-ref`, `contrast-ratio`, and `orphaned-tokens` warnings flag issues automatically.
5. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-selected`) — do not bury them in prose.
6. Keep `{colors.primary}` scarce. If two `button-primary` instances appear in the same viewport, the section is doing too much — neutralize one to `button-secondary`.
7. Treat `{colors.accent-magenta}` as a single-shot color: one promo CTA per page, never two.

## Known Gaps

- The exact pastel hex values of `{colors.block-*}` are derived from screenshot pixels; the production source likely uses named tokens that aren't exposed via CSS variables. Treat the documented hex values as faithful approximations rather than exact brand specs.
- Dark mode is not documented because the marketing site does not ship a dark theme — the closest analog is the navy color-block (`color-block-section-navy`) and the inverse-canvas footer.
- Form-field error and validation styling is not visible on `/contact/` because no error states render in the static screenshot. Inputs have hairline borders and rounded `{rounded.md}` corners; error treatment is not documented.
- The animated marquee-strip and color-block reveal animations are not documented (per the no-interaction policy).

## Overview

Wise — the global money-transfer brand — wears its identity in a single signature pairing: a vivid lime-green `{colors.primary}` (`#9fe870`) used as the CTA pill and brand accent, set against a pale sage-tinted canvas `{colors.canvas-soft}` (`#e8ebe6`) that runs across the hero band, and a near-black ink `{colors.ink}` (`#0e0f0c`) with a hint of warmth from the brand's underlying olive cast. The brand reads more like a calm Scandinavian magazine than a bank — generous whitespace, large rounded cards, and an unusually heavy display sans set at weight 900 carrying every hero headline.

Display typography is the second decisive voice. The proprietary `Wise Sans` family carries hero displays at weight 900 in scales from 64 px up to 126 px on the largest hero. The brand pairs Wise Sans 900 with Inter at weight 600 for sub-displays — the contrast between the chunky proprietary face and Inter's neutrality creates a particular hierarchy: Wise Sans for the brand moment, Inter for everything else.

Cards are universally pill-rounded — `{rounded.xl}` 24 px is the brand's signature card radius. Buttons take the same 24 px pill-rectangle shape. The brand never uses sharp corners on UI elements; the visual softness is part of the friendly fintech voice.

**Key Characteristics:**
- A single lime-green CTA accent `{colors.primary}` (`#9fe870`) — the brand's universal primary action color. No second accent.
- Two-face display typography — Wise Sans (proprietary, weight 900, hero scale) + Inter (weight 600, sub-display scale). The contrast is the brand's typographic story.
- `{rounded.xl}` 24 px is the canonical card and button radius. Generous, friendly.
- Sage-tinted canvas `{colors.canvas-soft}` (`#e8ebe6`) is the brand's hero surface; white `{colors.canvas}` is reserved for cards within the sage band.
- A full semantic palette: positive green family, warning yellow family, negative red family — each documented with content / hover / active variants for in-product use.
- Currency-converter card on the hero — the brand's signature interactive component, hosting from/to amount inputs.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Wise Green** (`{colors.primary}` — `#9fe870`): The brand's universal CTA color. Every primary button, every "Send money" pill, the brand's logo accent.
- **Wise Green Hover** (`{colors.primary-active}` — `#cdffad`): The lighter green for active state.
- **Wise Green Neutral** (`{colors.primary-neutral}` — `#c5edab`): A mid-saturation green used as a neutral active fill.
- **Wise Green Pale** (`{colors.primary-pale}` — `#e2f6d5`): The lightest green for soft surface tints / badge backgrounds.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): Pure white for card interiors.
- **Canvas Soft** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — `#e8ebe6`): The sage-tinted page background. Defining mood of the brand.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#0e0f0c`): Near-black with a hint of olive warmth — the brand's default text and headings color.
- **Ink Deep** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — `#163300`): A deep forest-green ink used on positive-state surfaces.
- **Body** (`{colors.body}` — `#454745`): Secondary body text.
- **Mute** (`{colors.mute}` — `#868685`): Lowest-priority text — captions, placeholder, fine print.

### Semantic
- **Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#2ead4b`): Success indicator.
- **Positive Deep** (`{colors.positive-deep}` — `#054d28`): Pressed positive state.
- **Warning** (`{colors.warning}` — `#ffd11a`): Caution indicator.
- **Warning Deep** (`{colors.warning-deep}` — `#b86700`): Pressed warning.
- **Warning Content** (`{colors.warning-content}` — `#4a3b1c`): Text on warning surfaces.
- **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#d03238`): Destructive / error red.
- **Negative Deep** (`{colors.negative-deep}` — `#a72027`): Pressed destructive.
- **Negative Darkest** (`{colors.negative-darkest}` — `#a7000d`): Highest-emphasis destructive text.
- **Negative Bg** (`{colors.negative-bg}` — `#320707`): Dark maroon for destructive callout backgrounds.

### Brand Accent — Tertiary
- **Accent Orange** (`{colors.accent-orange}` — `#ffc091`): Bright peach used inside illustrative content / pricing cards.
- **Accent Cyan** (`{colors.accent-cyan}` — `#38c8ff`): Bright sky-blue used as a tertiary illustration accent.

## Typography

### Font Family
Two faces ladder the system:
1. **Wise Sans** — proprietary geometric sans with an unusually heavy weight 900 used for all hero displays. The face is the brand's typographic signature. Always at weight 900, never lighter on the marketing surface.
2. **Inter** — used for sub-displays (weight 600), all body, and form labels. Loaded with `font-feature-settings: "calt"` for contextual alternates.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-mega}` | 126px | 900 | 107.1px | 0 | Hero stencil at maximum scale. |
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 96px | 900 | 81.6px | 0 | Sub-hero scale. |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 64px | 900 | 54.4px | 0 | Standard hero headline. |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 47px | 400 | 70.5px | -0.108px | Lighter sub-display. |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 40px | 900 | 34px | 0 | Section / card headlines. |
| `{typography.display-sm}` | 32px | 600 | 38.4px | -0.96px | Inter-rendered section headings. |
| `{typography.display-xs}` | 24px | 600 | 31.2px | -0.48px | Sub-section displays. |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 20px | 400 | 30px | 0 | Lead paragraphs. |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 24px | 0 | Default body. |
| `{typography.body-md-strong}` | 16px | 600 | 24px | 0 | Bold inline body. |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 20px | 0 | Secondary body. |
| `{typography.body-sm-strong}` | 14px | 600 | 20px | 0 | Bold caption / nav-link. |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 16px | 0 | Fine print. |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 16px | 600 | 24px | 0 | Button label. |

### Principles
- **Weight 900 for hero, weight 600 for everything else.** The brand's display ceiling is full-black weight; everything below is semibold.
- **Wise Sans for the brand voice, Inter for utility.** Strict role separation.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Wise Sans is proprietary. Open-source substitutes:
- **Display** — *Inter* at weight 900 or *Manrope* at weight 800 / 900 captures the geometric heaviness. *Geist* weight 800 is a passable second choice.
- **Sub-display + body** — *Inter* is the brand's actual second face.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 4 px.
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2 px · `{spacing.xs}` 4 px · `{spacing.sm}` 8 px · `{spacing.md}` 12 px · `{spacing.lg}` 16 px · `{spacing.xl}` 24 px · `{spacing.2xl}` 32 px · `{spacing.3xl}` 48 px.
- **Section padding**: bands use `{spacing.3xl}` 48 px top/bottom on desktop.
- **Card interior**: cards at `{spacing.xl}` 24 px.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing container centres at ~1200 px.
- Hero: split layout (headline left, currency-converter card right) at desktop; stacked at mobile.
- Feature grids: 2-up / 3-up at desktop.

### Responsive Strategy

#### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 768px | Hero stacks; converter card full-width below headline; grids 1-up. |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Grids 2-up. |
| Desktop | ≥ 1024px | Hero split; full grids. |

#### Touch Targets
Buttons render ~48 px tall (12 vertical padding + 24 line). WCAG AAA at all widths.

#### Image Behavior
Photography is sparse; the brand prefers illustrative SVGs and product mockups inside cards. Country flag thumbnails appear inside currency rows.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Level 0 — Flat | No shadow, no border. | Default. |
| Level 1 — Hairline on Dark | 1 px solid `{colors.ink}` border. | Tertiary outline buttons, form inputs. |
| Level 2 — Soft Card | Implicit Level 0 white card sitting on sage canvas — the surface contrast IS the elevation. | Cards on the sage hero band. |

The brand uses surface contrast (`{colors.canvas-soft}` background vs `{colors.canvas}` cards) as the primary elevation cue.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0px | Full-bleed bands. |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 8px | Inline pills, small badges. |
| `{rounded.md}` | 12px | Form inputs, smaller chrome. |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 16px | Mid-size cards. |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 24px | The brand's canonical button + card radius. |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Status pills and full-radius accents. |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Circular icon containers. |

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — the lime-green CTA pill.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, label `{typography.button-md}`, padding `{spacing.md} {spacing.xl}`, shape `{rounded.xl}` 24 px.

**`button-secondary`** — the sage-tinted secondary.
- Background `{colors.canvas-soft}`, text `{colors.ink}`, same typography / padding / shape.

**`hero-band-dark`** — the polarity-flipped dark hero.
- Background `{colors.ink}`, text `{colors.primary}` (Wise green headline on near-black!), same padding / scale.

**`content-band`** — the white content band that follows hero.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.3xl} {spacing.xl}`. Section headline in `{typography.display-md}`.

### Examples (illustrative)

> Auto-derived kit-mirror demonstration surfaces (`scripts/derive-examples-block.mjs`). Each `ex-*` entry references brand-native primitives so downstream consumers (`/preview-design`, `/generate-kit`) re-skin the same 10 surfaces consistently. `TO_FILL` markers indicate missing primitives — resolve in the LLM judgment pass.

**`ex-pricing-tier`** — Default Pricing tier card. Re-uses feature-card chrome with brand canvas-soft surface.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `borderColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-pricing-tier-featured`** — Featured/highlighted tier — polarity-flipped surface (dark fill + light text in light mode, light fill + dark text in dark mode).
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-product-selector`** — What's Included summary card — re-purposed for SaaS / B2B verticals (NOT a literal product gallery).
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-cart-drawer`** — Subscription summary — re-purposed for SaaS / B2B (line items per add-on, not literal cart).
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`, `item-divider`

**`ex-app-shell-row`** — Sidebar nav row inside the App Shell example. Active state uses brand primary as the indicator.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `activeIndicator`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-data-table-cell`** — Default data-table th + td chrome. Header uses mono-caps eyebrow typography; body uses body-sm.
- Properties: `headerBackground`, `headerTypography`, `bodyTypography`, `cellPadding`, `rowBorder`

**`ex-auth-form-card`** — Sign-in / sign-up card. Re-uses feature-card chrome with text-input primitives inside.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-modal-card`** — Modal dialog surface — same chrome as feature-card with elevated shadow.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`

**`ex-empty-state-card`** — Empty-state illustration frame.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`, `captionTypography`

**`ex-toast`** — Toast notification surface — feature-card shape + medium shadow.
- Properties: `backgroundColor`, `rounded`, `padding`, `typography`


## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` Wise green for every primary CTA. The lime-green pill IS the brand's conversion signature.
- Set hero headlines in `{typography.display-mega}` / `{typography.display-xl}` Wise Sans weight 900. Never lighter.
- Use `{rounded.xl}` 24 px for buttons and cards. The generous radius is the brand's friendliness signature.
- Cycle page surfaces in `{colors.canvas-soft}` sage canvas → `{colors.canvas}` white cards. Surface contrast carries elevation.
- Use the full semantic palette (positive / warning / negative) for in-product status — never repurpose Wise green as success indicator since it IS the brand CTA.

### Don't
- Don't introduce a second brand accent. Wise green is the sole identity colour.
- Don't render the hero in weight 700 or lighter. The brand's display weight is 900.
- Don't render CTAs as sharp rectangles. The 24 px pill geometry is non-negotiable.
- Don't pair the green CTA with a green background. The brand always sits Wise green on neutral surfaces (sage / white / ink).
- Don't replace Wise Sans with a generic geometric sans for hero typography — the proprietary face IS the brand's voice.

description: An inspired interpretation of Stripi's design language — a financial-infrastructure brand built on a deep navy ink, an electric indigo primary, and a recurring atmospheric gradient mesh that occupies the upper third of nearly every marketing page. The system pairs the proprietary Sohne family at thin (300) weights with negative letter-spacing for editorial-density display headlines, and uses tabular-figure body type where money and numerics matter. Buttons are tight-radius pills, cards live on near-white surfaces, and the dashboard track flips polarity to a familiar dark-app shell.

## Overview

Stripi's design language opens with the gradient mesh. A wide horizontal band of pastel cream, sherbet orange, lavender, electric indigo, and ruby pink occupies the upper third of nearly every marketing page — the brand's instantly-recognizable atmospheric backdrop. Type and product UI mockups float above it on `{colors.canvas}` (white), with the gradient acting as both decoration and visual anchor. The lower portion of the page returns to white, with feature explanations on `{colors.canvas-soft}` (a barely-tinted cool off-white) and dashboard product mockups composited as faux IDE/console panels in deep navy.

The color system has two primary roles. **Indigo** (`{colors.primary}` — `#533afd`) is the brand's signature CTA color, used sparingly: one filled pill per band. **Deep navy** (`{colors.ink}` — `#0d253d`) is the universal body text color and the fill of dashboard mockups, the featured pricing tier, and the dark-app surfaces on the dashboard track. Ruby (`{colors.ruby}`) and magenta (`{colors.magenta}`) appear inside the gradient mesh and as accent dots in product UI mockups; they are not used as button colors.

Typography is built around **Sohne** at weight 300 with negative letter-spacing — the brand's editorial-density display signature. Display sizes (32–56px) use -1.4px to -0.64px tracking; body sizes use 0; tabular caption sizes (where money and numerics matter) use the OpenType `tnum` feature plus a tightening -0.36 to -0.42px tracking. The `ss01` stylistic set is enabled across all roles.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Gradient-mesh backdrop on every marketing hero — cream/orange/lavender/indigo/ruby horizontally washed across the upper third of the page.
- Single-indigo CTA hierarchy: filled `{colors.primary}` pill is the only filled button on marketing surfaces.
- Sohne thin (weight 300) display tier with negative tracking from -1.4px to -0.2px depending on size.
- Tabular-figure body type (`tnum`) for any cell containing money or numerics — the brand's quiet financial-data signal.
- Dark-app dashboard track: deep navy product UI mockups sit composited above the white canvas, frequently with rendered code or dashboard tables inside.
- Pill-shaped buttons (`{rounded.pill}` 9999px) with tight `8px 16px` padding — short, decisive, transactional.
- Cream-band feature cards (`{colors.canvas-cream}`) introduce a warm interlude between blue/white sections without breaking the brand's chromatic logic.

## Colors

> **Source pages:** home (`/`), `/payments`, `/pricing`, `dashboard.stripe.com/register/payments`.

### Brand & Accent
- **Indigo** (`{colors.primary}` — `#533afd`): The brand's signature CTA color. Filled-pill button, link emphasis, gradient anchor.
- **Indigo Deep** (`{colors.primary-deep}` — `#4434d4`): A deeper indigo used in gradient mid-stops and as the press-state warmer alternative.
- **Indigo Press** (`{colors.primary-press}` — `#2e2b8c`): Pressed-state lift of the primary.
- **Indigo Soft** (`{colors.primary-soft}` — `#665efd`): A lighter indigo used in product-UI accents and chart highlights.
- **Indigo Subdued** (`{colors.primary-bg-subdued-hover}` — `#b9b9f9`): Pale indigo fill used as soft tag background.
- **Brand Dark 900** (`{colors.brand-dark-900}` — `#1c1e54`): The deep navy used on the featured pricing tier and dashboard chrome.
- **Ruby** (`{colors.ruby}` — `#ea2261`): Gradient accent and chart highlight; never a button.
- **Magenta** (`{colors.magenta}` — `#f96bee`): Brighter pink stop in gradient meshes.
- **Lemon** (`{colors.lemon}` — `#9b6829`): Warm sherbet stop in gradient backdrops.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): Default page background.
- **Canvas Soft** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — `#f6f9fc`): Cool-tinted off-white used on feature bands beneath the gradient hero.
- **Canvas Cream** (`{colors.canvas-cream}` — `#f5e9d4`): Warm cream used as a feature-band fill — the brand's chromatic interlude.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e3e8ee`): 1px borders on cards and tables.
- **Hairline Input** (`{colors.hairline-input}` — `#a8c3de`): Slightly cooler hairline used on form inputs.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#0d253d`): Default body text color across the brand. Deep navy, never pure black.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.ink-secondary}` — `#273951`): Secondary text on white.
- **Ink Mute** (`{colors.ink-mute}` — `#64748d`): Helper text, captions, table labels.
- **Ink Mute 2** (`{colors.ink-mute-2}` — `#61718a`): Near-equivalent to ink-mute used in nav.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` — `#ffffff`): Text on indigo / dark-navy surfaces.

### Semantic
The brand does not use a separate semantic color palette in the marketing system — error / success states live in dashboard-product UI specifically.

## Typography

### Font Family

The display and UI tier is **Sohne** (proprietary, licensed from Klim Type Foundry) at weights 300 (thin) and 400 (regular). The variable font (`sohne-var`) is loaded with `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` enabled globally — the stylistic set substitutes a single-story `a` and other character variants that are part of the brand's typographic signature.

When Sohne is unavailable, fall back to **SF Pro Display** at thin weights, then system-ui. For maximum brand fidelity, **Inter** (open-source) at weight 300 with `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` and `letter-spacing: -1.4px` on display sizes approximates the rhythm closely.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xxl}` | 56px | 300 | 1.03 | -1.4px | Hero headline |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 48px | 300 | 1.15 | -0.96px | Section opener |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 32px | 300 | 1.1 | -0.64px | Card title / sub-section |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 26px | 300 | 1.12 | -0.26px | Compact card title |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 22px | 300 | 1.1 | -0.22px | Pricing tier name |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 20px | 300 | 1.4 | -0.2px | Section sub-heading |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 18px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Mini-section label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Marketing body lead |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 15px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Default UI body |
| `{typography.body-tabular}` | 14px | 300 | 1.4 | -0.42px | Money / numeric tables (uses `tnum`) |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.0 | 0 | Pill button label |
| `{typography.button-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.0 | 0 | Compact pill label |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 400 | 1.4 | -0.39px | Helper, table labels |
| `{typography.micro}` | 11px | 300 | 1.4 | 0 | Fine print |
| `{typography.micro-cap}` | 10px | 400 | 1.15 | 0.1px | All-caps eyebrow |

### Principles
- **Thin weight is the brand.** Display tiers always render at weight 300. Bumping to 400+ removes the brand's editorial air.
- **Negative tracking on display.** -1.4px at 56px, scaling proportionally down to -0.2px at 20px. The negative tracking is the brand's typographic signature.
- **Tabular figures for money.** Any cell rendering currency, transaction amounts, or numeric counts uses `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` plus a tightening tracking. The brand quietly signals its financial DNA through this micro-detail.
- **`ss01` globally.** Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` to the body element so the stylistic-set substitution is on for every text role.

### Note on Font Substitutes
Sohne is proprietary. Use **Inter** (open-source via Google Fonts) at weight 300 with `letter-spacing: -1.4px` and `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` for display tiers — Inter is the closest open-source analogue. For body sizes, Inter at 300 weight with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` (where applicable) is the canonical substitute. Avoid Helvetica or system-ui defaults — they're heavier than the brand needs.

## Layout

### Spacing System
- **Base unit**: 8px (with 2 / 4 / 12 sub-tokens for fine work).
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 2px · `{spacing.xs}` 4px · `{spacing.sm}` 8px · `{spacing.md}` 12px · `{spacing.lg}` 16px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.huge}` 64px.
- **Section padding**: 64–96px on marketing surfaces; 32–48px on dashboard / product surfaces.
- **Card internal padding**: 32px on feature cards; 24px on dashboard mockups.

### Grid & Container
- Marketing pages center in a ~1200px container with the gradient mesh extending edge-to-edge above.
- Pricing collapses 4-up → 2-up → 1-up at 1024 / 768 breakpoints.
- Dashboard product mockups use their own internal grids (12-col tables, 3-col card grids) rendered as static composites.

### Whitespace Philosophy
The gradient mesh occupies the upper third of the page; the white canvas below is generously padded. Section gaps tend toward 96px, with content tightening to 32px on dashboard / pricing pages where users compare and act.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Default surface |
| 1 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,55,112,0.08) 0 1px 3px` | Card lift on white |
| 2 | `box-shadow: rgba(0,55,112,0.08) 0 8px 24px, rgba(0,55,112,0.04) 0 2px 6px` | Floating panels, dashboard mockup chrome |
| 3 | Gradient mesh backdrop | The brand's primary depth medium — atmospheric color rather than literal shadow |

### Decorative Depth
The gradient mesh IS the depth system. Implemented as a layered SVG or large background image rather than CSS gradients (the actual mesh has organic blob shapes that aren't CSS-renderable). The mesh provides the brand's signature lift; literal shadows are reserved for product-UI mockups and stay subtle.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Hairline tags, table chrome |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Form inputs |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Compact cards, alerts |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Pricing cards, feature cards |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Dashboard product mockup chrome |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | All buttons, tag pills |

### Photography Geometry
The brand uses **product UI mockups** more than photography. Dashboard composites render as faux IDE/terminal/dashboard chrome inside `{rounded.lg}` 12px containers with a subtle `box-shadow`. Real photography appears in customer logo strips and the rare case-study card; treated as inset 4:3 with no shadow.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary-pill`** — the dominant CTA system-wide.
- Background `{colors.primary}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, type `{typography.button-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}` (8px 16px), rounded `{rounded.pill}` 9999px.
- Pressed state `button-primary-pill-pressed` shifts background to `{colors.primary-press}`.

**`button-secondary`** — outline-style alternative.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.primary}`, 1px solid `{colors.primary}` border, same pill geometry.

**`button-on-dark`** — used on dashboard / dark surfaces.
- Background `{colors.brand-dark-900}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, same pill geometry.

### Cards & Containers

**`card-feature-light`** — feature explanation card on white.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border, optional Level 1 shadow.

**`card-pricing`** — standard pricing tier.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Title `{typography.heading-lg}`, price `{typography.display-md}`, body `{typography.body-md}`, CTA pinned bottom as `button-primary-pill`.

**`card-pricing-featured`** — the inverted dark featured tier.
- Background `{colors.brand-dark-900}`, text `{colors.on-primary}`, otherwise identical structure to `card-pricing`. The deep-navy fill is the brand's distinctive featured-tier choice.

**`card-cream-band`** — warm interlude card.
- Background `{colors.canvas-cream}`, text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.xxl}`, rounded `{rounded.lg}`. Used to break up the indigo / white rhythm with warmth.

**`card-dashboard-mockup`** — composited dashboard / product UI screenshot.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, type `{typography.body-tabular}` (with `tnum`), padding `{spacing.xl}` 24px, rounded `{rounded.lg}` 12px, Level 2 shadow. Often contains nested mini-mockups: code preview + dashboard table + chart card.

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`** — standard form field.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink}`, type `{typography.body-md}`, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` (8px 12px), rounded `{rounded.sm}` 6px, 1px `{colors.hairline-input}` border.
- Focus state `text-input-focused`: border swaps to `{colors.primary}`.

### Navigation

**`nav-bar-on-mesh`** — top nav floating over the gradient hero.
- Background `{colors.canvas}` (or transparent depending on scroll), text `{colors.ink}`, padding `{spacing.lg} {spacing.xl}`. Logo wordmark on the left, primary nav center, sign-in + filled `button-primary-pill` on the right.

### Pills, Tags, and Chips

**`pill-tag-soft`** — subdued indigo tag.
- Background `{colors.primary-bg-subdued-hover}`, text `{colors.primary-deep}`, type `{typography.micro-cap}`, padding `4px 8px`, rounded `{rounded.pill}`.

### Signature Components

**Gradient Mesh Backdrop** — pastel cream → sherbet orange → lavender → indigo → ruby pink stops blurred horizontally across the upper third of the page. Implemented as SVG or a large background image — not a flat CSS gradient (the real mesh has organic blob shapes).

**Composited Dashboard Mockup** — multi-layer faux-product-UI compositions: an IDE panel on the left, a dashboard table center, a chart card on the right, all rendered at small scale inside `{rounded.lg}` containers with subtle Level 2 shadows. The composite is the brand's most-photographed feature.

**Tabular-Figure Money Type** — every number rendering money, count, or transaction value uses `font-feature-settings: "tnum"`. The brand's quiet signal that it's a financial-infrastructure platform.

**`link-on-light`** — inline links on light surfaces.
- Text `{colors.primary}` rendered in `{typography.body-md}`, no underline by default.

**`footer-light`** — site-wide footer.
- Background `{colors.canvas}`, text `{colors.ink-mute}`, type `{typography.caption}`, padding `{spacing.huge} {spacing.xl}` (64px 24px). Holds 4–6 columns of link groups, social icons, and a small legal row.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for filled CTAs and inline link emphasis — it should appear sparingly, one filled button per band.
- Apply the gradient mesh to every marketing hero; bare-canvas heroes feel off-brand.
- Render display tiers at weight 300 with negative letter-spacing — the thin tracking is the typographic signature.
- Use `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` on every money / numeric cell.
- Apply `font-feature-settings: "ss01"` globally on the body element.
- Pair every feature explanation with a composited product UI mockup; the brand's argument is "look at the actual product."

### Don't
- Don't bump display weight above 300 — at 400 the brand's editorial air collapses.
- Don't add new accent colors outside the documented gradient stops (cream / orange / lavender / indigo / ruby / magenta).
- Don't use the indigo `{colors.primary}` as a body-text color — it's a CTA and link color, not a type color at body size.
- Don't shrink button padding below `8px 16px` — the tight pill is part of the brand's transactional feel.
- Don't render money cells without `tnum` — it breaks the quiet financial-data signature.
- Don't replace the pill shape with rounded-rectangles for buttons.

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Wide | ≥ 1440px | Full gradient mesh edge-to-edge; dashboard composite at full scale |
| Desktop | 1024–1440px | Default content max-width; pricing 4-up |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Pricing 2-up; dashboard composite simplifies to 2 panels |
| Mobile | < 768px | Pricing 1-up; hamburger nav; display drops 56 → 36px |

### Touch Targets
- Pill buttons hit ≥ 40×40px on mobile via padding scaling. On smaller screens, buttons size up to 44×44px to maintain WCAG AAA.
- Form fields stay at 40px minimum height.

### Collapsing Strategy
- Display tiers stair-step 56 → 48 → 32 → 26 → 22px through the breakpoints.
- Gradient mesh re-tiles on mobile to preserve the wash without disappearing.
- Dashboard composites simplify to single-panel mockups on mobile; the multi-layer composition only renders at desktop+.
- Pricing tiers stair-step 4-up → 2-up → 1-up.

### Image Behavior
Product UI composites use `srcset` with art-direction crops at major breakpoints. Mobile crops focus on the most actionable inner panel; desktop crops show the full multi-layer composition.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time.
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.primary}`, `{button-primary-pill}-pressed`, `{rounded.pill}`).
3. Run `npx @google/design.md lint DESIGN.md` after edits.
4. Add new variants as separate entries.
5. Default body to `{typography.body-md}` (15px); use `{typography.body-tabular}` for any money / numeric cell.
6. Apply `ss01` globally on the body; apply `tnum` per-element on numeric content.
7. The gradient mesh is non-negotiable on marketing heroes — bare-canvas heroes break the brand.
